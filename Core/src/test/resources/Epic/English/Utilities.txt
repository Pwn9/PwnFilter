# ---------- Important Information ----------
# This scripting code has no warranty or remedies, whether expressed or
#	 implied, and is provided "as is".
# The following scripting code is designed for the following servers:
#	Minecraft -> Bukkit -> Pwnfilter Plugin
# There is a goal to make this code universal for cross-platforms
# 	on many other game servers. Support for other games is currently
#	in development.  If you wish to participate and help develop this
#	code, please contact EpicATrain at the email below.
# THIS WORK IS COPYRIGHTED WITH THE UNITED STATES LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.

# This work may be distributed in current format free of charge as
# 	long as this work remains free of charge and used only on the
#	game servers listed above.
# Server administrators may modify this work to their preference for
#	their server only, if so desired, as long as such work remains property

# This entire script is written so that any admin can edit out most
# 	parts of this filter to his or her liking.  To stop a word from
# 	being filtered, simply put a pound sign (#) next to the lines of
# 	code you want to turn off.
# It's highly NOT recommended to delete lines of code in case you
# 	want to turn it back on at a later date.
#
# If you wish to exclude certain players from being filtered from certain
#   parts of the language filter, then please add their names to the ignore
#   Admins section below of the conditiongroup ignoreAdmins. This is an
#   easier way for admins to exclude certain players from being filtered
#   from non-esssential filters such as the advertising filters, Big Bertha,
#   The Fat Fury, and Fat Albert.
#
# If you also so desire, you can put your website in the section below
#   listed website so when players type !website, your website can be
#   displayed on your server.  This can be a very handy tool.
#
# One last cool thing to mention, in the previous version of my language filter,
#   it was difficult to understand where to put your server information
#   to ensure that you got the best results when using my advertising filters.
#   I've since completely rewritten everything and with the help of Sage905
#   and tremor77, we have brought to you a new design to ignore servers in
#   the advertising filters.  Simply add your server to the list of ignored
#   servers in the conditiongroup ignoreServers. You can add as many as you
#   like or as few as you like, or none at all! It couldn't be any simplier.
